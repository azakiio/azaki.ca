    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Adham Zaki – but my friends just call me Zaki</p>
    <p>I’m studying <b>Industrial Engineering</b> with a specialty in Operations Research and Information Engineering at
      the <b>University of Toronto.</b> I’m also pursuing a Minor in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and a Certificate in
      <b>Engineering
        Leadership.</b></p>
    <p>I’ve previously interned at <b>Procter & Gamble</b> as a Web & Search Analyst on their <b>Digital Marketing
        Optimization
        team.</b> In addition to working on the analytics side, I also developed new plugins for an open-source <a
        href="https://www.knime.com/">tool</a> that is used at P&G.</p>
    <p>Take a look at my <a href="#">Resum&eacute;</a> if you're interested</p>

    <h3>Values</h3>
    <p><b>Curiosity:</b> I love asking questions and always try to keep an open mind. ‘Why?’ is my favourite question. I
      ask is constantly, especially when the topic is new to me. This approach gives me a deeper understanding and
      appreciation of whatever I’m learning because I’m starting at a more fundamental level, the Why.</p>
    <p><b>Efficiency:</b> Be it an algorithm that could faster or a set of resources that could be better allocated, it
      pains me
      when things aren’t done efficiently. The idea that you can get more value out of something without needing to add
      anything (such as through doing existing things in a different order) is really appealing to me and is the main
      reason I specialized in Operations Research which is all about optimizing processes and decision making. This also
      ties in with my first value, because curiosity acts as the driving force to discover more efficient solutions.</p>
    <p><b>Fun:</b> I think having fun is a key element that a lot of people either forget about or don’t attribute
      enough value
      to. George Bernard Shaw famously said: We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop
      playing. Aside from the obvious benefits of stress reduction and improved interpersonal relationships, it appears
      that fun activities that introduce us to new ideas and concepts foster self-directed learning and higher
      information retention; both crucial for curiosity and efficiency.</p>

    <h3>Passion</h3>
    <p>Given my values, it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that I have a passion for <b>teaching.</b>
      In addition to educating and inspiring others, teaching is one of the best ways to reinforce and consolidate our
      own knowledge (learn more <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/">here</a>).</p>
    <p>If we are to teach something well, we often have to simplify complex ideas that are fully formed and self-evident
      in our minds, but
      that cannot be transferred directly to the minds of others without
      breaking them down into smaller, simpler chunks. This is an incredibly valuable activity.</p>
    <p>My favourite teachers back in school injected fun into their classes to keep me curious, to ensure that I stay
      intrigued and came back for more. A big part of what I was able to achieve so far is thanks to amazing teachers
      I’ve
      had in the past and would like to pay that forward someday.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies &amp; Background</h3>
    <p>My hobbies include <b>gaming, swimming, doing escape rooms</b> with my friends, and <b>coding</b> these little side-projects
      you can find around here. I’ve also recently picked up the <b>guitar</b> and have been practicing when I get the chance.
    </p>
    <p>I’m fluent in <b>English</b> and <b>German</b> and able to hold a conversation in <b>Arabic</b> and (sometimes) <b>French.</b> I grew up in
      Dubai and I wen’t to a German school where all four languages are taught.</p>
